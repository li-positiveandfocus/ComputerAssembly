# ComputerAssembly
Basic computer organization including the von Neumann architecture, the instruction cycle,
parts of a CPU (central processing unit), pipeling, memory hierarchy, and interrupt handling.
Representation of numerical and non-numerical data. Translation to assembly code from highlevel
constructs such as if statements, loops, and function calls.

1. Describe the instruction cycle and the role played by each major CPU and storage
component in the cycle.
2. Perform manipulations, conversions, and arithmetic at the machine level using two's complement
integers, floating point numbers, characters, pointers, and arrays.
3. Create assembly language programs by translating familiar higher-level language
constructs to assembly, and verify that the results function correctly.
4. Use a stack discipline to demonstrate how procedures and procedure calls are
implemented in assembly language.
